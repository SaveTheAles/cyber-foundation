### About euler&cyber Foundation(s) 
- euler~Foundation: is the testing of the Foundation DAO. It is deployed to ETH's mainnet during GoL (gamified part of cybers distribution process). Its main purpose is to test everything, that can be tested, before the launch of the mainnet and provide the initialization for the security audit on the initial stage, plus obtain feedback from the cyber community
- cyber~Foundation: is the community governing DAO behind cyber. It will consist of stakeholders that wish to be part of the governing process. The Foundation, apart from everything, will be in charge of the ETH pot donated to it during cyber ~Auction (part of cybers distribution process). Making it is a true Decentralized Autonomous Organisation in charge of its own funds and decisions via reaching consensus
