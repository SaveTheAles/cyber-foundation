### About the app
This is an Aragon based app for cyber\~Foundation:

- [The Code of the app](https://github.com/cybercongress/aragon-evangelism-app)
- The app in [the foundation DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation) on Aragon

An application for cyber\~Evangelists. This app lets anyone apply to be blessed to become an evangelist and make the web great again! 

The evangelists in Cyber are the ambassadors of the project. They spread the love about Cyber to the masses and get rewarded for it.

Acknowledged takeoff Evangelists will be eligible to 10% of all donations in ATOMs, which they have generated during the Game of Links and Game of Thrones, and other perks, such as CYB rewards for certain provable actions. 

The perks in CYB tokens are rewarded to participants from the community pool of the project which is governed by cyber\~Foundation. 

Please note, the initial decision to reward up to 1 TCYB from the community pool to evangelists, was made by the cyber\~Congress DAO, as part of the projects initial distribution. 

The Evangelist will empower the project and involve some bright minds into the bootstrap of the Superintelligence.
