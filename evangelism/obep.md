## Idea
As stated in [the whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x) we will use [the distribution games](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#the-distribution-games-in-detail) to achieve a better allocation of tokens. 

The current state of the blockchain industry is twofold. The good part is that so much innovation is happening as we speak. The bad part is that a large chunk of these innovations, especially post-hype, are reliably covered by a thick layer of shitty projects. This means that we have to find our way to break through this thick layer of shit. We believe that we have the most important flavouring, which is a [working network](https://cyber.page/brain) and [a basic application](https://cyber.page). However, since our appetiser consists of user-generated ingredients, to move forward with the idea of a greater, decentralized search, we need *more engagement*. But how do we get people to know about us?

Without much ado, we want to announce the Open Bootstrap Evangelism Program or OBEP. Acknowledged Evangelists will be eligible to 10% of all donations in ATOMs, which they have generated during [the Game of Links](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#game-of-links-or-gol), [Game of Thrones](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#game-of-thrones-or-got) and other perks.

## Perks
- Rewards in ATOM
- CYB tokens for particular actions
- Honourable lifetime badge *Cybers Genesis Evangelist*
- Early knowledge of popularity mechanisms in web3
- A possibility to become an early adopter of web3

## Rules
There are NO guidelines or rules for the program itself. Do what you believe will work. However, 2 requirements are necessary to receive rewards:

1. You must become an acknowledged Evangelist to receive a reward in ATOM or/and CYB. We want to exclude scam behaviour and situations when the project has been evangelised by people without a thorough understanding of the project.
2. You must have proof that a particular donation came thanks to your amazing evangelism. An address or a nickname in the memo field of the donated transaction is proof that no one can reject. Achieve this with your special link.

## How?
Go to [cyber.page/evangelism](https://cyber.page/evangelism) and apply for the program. You will either receive an automated acknowledgement (blessing) or we will contact you to ask you any additional questions. For example, we could ask you to commit something to the knowledge graph. Or you might get accepted based on the fact that you have helped to bring in donations. So don't hesitate. That is decentralization. Do not wait for our approval, but please understand our concern! Manual acknowledgements are the only way that our project can defend itself from scammers at this early stage.

Once you apply, you will get your referral link. It looks like this:
```
https://cyber.page?thanks=yournick
```
You can append `?thanks=[yournick]` to any part of the [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/) app. e.g:
```
https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff?thanks=yournick
https://cyber.page/search/cyber?thanks=yournick
```

Referral attributions work on last click basis.

## Whom?
Cosmos wallets, explorers, bloggers and masters of different crypto channels are welcome to participate. We know,  it's a natural process for you. But previous accomplishments are not a must. You can try and build your own community around a new idea. You decide how and what to do to achieve this. We believe this will help to generate healthy competition between the participants of the program.

## Path
We believe it is important to understand the working of what is under the hood. One of our noble goals is to create a new verb:

```
cyber: to do something intelligent, to find something smart
```

The path with the necessary information to kick you off:

1. Read the starting materials: [whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPjbx76LycfzSSWMcnni6YVvV3UNhTrYzyPMuiA9UQM3x), the [homestead documentation](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md), [ELI-5 FAQ](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md), [our blog](https://cybercongress.ai/post/), [Game of Links rules](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/), [gift info](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Gift%20FAQ%20and%20general%20gift%20information.md). It would be a good idea to discover [Protoschool](https://proto.school/) and get some tutorials about how [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) works. You don't need to fully understand all of this, but try to grasp the general idea and get a feel of it. Check out the tutorials in the homestead.

2. Feel free to go on and test [cyber~Page](https://cyber.page/). Cyberlink something. Try to [search something](https://cyber.page/search/help). Go to the [Game of Links monitor](https://cyber.page/gol) and enjoy our approach of a decentralised launch of a superintelligent computer. Learn the [stats](https://cyber.page/brain). Imagine [how cool](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/usecases.md) the search could be if we teach cyber a bit more together.

3. Find out that everything is real and [the code is 100% open](https://github.com/cybercongress).

4. If you have questions, go to our [TG channel](https://t.me/fuckgoogle). If you want to spur a discussion, then you are welcome at [cyber~Forum](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/). Or you can spread the love with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress/) or any [other social channels](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#partnering-communities).

5. It's time to act. Here are the ideas:

|Action  | Rewards | Terms |
|:----------|:-------------:|------:|
| [Translation](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/issues/32) | 20 GCYB | Any language! |
| [Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS6w6wiAag4&list=PLOcP3DXQoNUXmh7ob0Fm6p12L20zn0zbT&index=6) | 20 GCYB | One person - one meetup. Video proof |
| [Community creation](https://t.me/fuckgoogle) | 2 GCYB | One person - one channel. Discussion proof |
| [Content creation](https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/mentions-of-the-beast-in-the-wild/40/55) |  2 GCYB |  Video, podcast or blog. Unlimited per person
| [Donation](https://cyber.page/takeoff)  | 1 GCYB  | For each 1k ATOM donated |

*Please note, that payouts will only be done if the results are cyberlinked and content proof exists.*

We are not defining quality terms. Most likely, you will still receive a reward for shitty content if the task was done, but expect to be disqualified from the program, or instructed, depending on your will to learn. 

Coordinator aka @serejandmyself will have a personal incentive in the form CYB for evangelist attraction. For the first evangelist (not including team members of cyber~Congress) the coordinator receives 15 GCYB. For every next evangelist (not including team members of cyber ~Congress) the reward decreases by 10%. 

## Source
The source of ATOM rewards are the donations during the Takeoff and Game of Links. cyber~Congress is responsible for paying out this type of reward. 

The source of CYB rewards is the community pool. The coordinator will propose this program to the community and will manage a `1 TCYB` budget. The monetary rules are the following:

1. The coordinator pays out on: first come - first served basis
2. Once the budget runs out, the coordinator decides on whether to stop the program or ask for additional funding via a governance proposal
3. If unused until the end of the program, the coordinator returns the funds to the community pool

## Conclusion
We believe this program will empower the project and involve some bright minds into the [bootstrap of Superintelligence](https://cyber.page/episode-1)
