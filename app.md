Picture: mountain, forest, river, beach, sun, well, sea.

Price * Balance = Total

Chart supply with price

=> [amount] GTHC Buy


## Magic Forest

=> Subscribe to cyberCongress feed

## Mountain of Force

THC price =

Every rebase the price of the bonding curve is adjusted.

UX:

Amount of THC and OIL in cyberFoundation

Some time science is a lot more art than science. A lot of people dont get that

=> Buy THC from cyberFoundation

## Liquid Flow

By depositing tokens {you have} you get gAsset which will give you THC rewards

You gotta do it for Grandpa, Morty. You gotta put these seeds inside your butt.

=> Deposit / Redeem

## Staking Beach

Staker rewards =

=> Stake / Unstake on LiquidityRatio

## Deep Sea

Considering that the same mechanics can be applied to any fungible token we distinct them as a new asset class called "elastic". We created a factory which allow to deploy them easily.

Factory for deploying: params: percent for self, contract for self, base token contract

UX:

List of elastics sorted by cap with the following collumns
- price
- supply
- liquidity
- turnover
- cap

=> click on the line: Buy or Sell
=> Create elastic

## Oil well

Oil is extracted from oil well. Oil helps store and transfer gas. The only difference between average elastic is that there exist special price oracle which incentivize calls in order to determine gas price for rebase.

UX:

OIL price chart (target/actual)

=> Report price

## Sun

The same as Uniswap swap dialog.

Returns eth spent for gas. Tx fees are set by governance, split between burn and cyberFoundation, burn rate is set by governance,

Lets scam the scammers ...

=> Send / Swap

The world is full of isiots that dont understand what is important

The love is to risk it all ...

If you are the smartest person in the room you are in the small room



Uncertainty is inherintly unsustainable. Eventuallly, everythin is either is or isnt

Gte your shiot togather



I am a scientist . When I dont like something about the world I change it


School is a waste of time

This pickle doesn’t care about your children. I’m not gonna take their dreams. I’m gonna take their parents

“Do you wanna develop an app?”

My appearance is designed to be familiar and to put you at ease.”

“Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We’re all going to die.

“You ever hear about Wall Street, Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy boardrooms? They take their balls and they dip them in cocaine and wipe them all over each other.”

Don’t get drawn into the culture, Morty. Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing.
